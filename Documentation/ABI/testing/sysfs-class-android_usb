Android USB devices (eg. /sys/class/android_usb/android0/)

What:		/sys/class/android_usb/<android_device>/state
Date:		Feb 2024
Contact:	Neill Kapron <nkapron@google.com>
Description:
		The state of the USB connection. This attribute is likely
		redundant with the /sys/class/UDC/state attribute, and should
		be deprecated/removed when userspace can be refactored.
		Change on the state will also generate uevent KOBJ_CHANGE on
		the port with the new state included in the message as
		"USB_STATE=<STATE>". Note this is not the correct usage of
		uevents, but necessary due to the requirement to maintaine
		userspace API compatibility.

		Valid values: CONNECTED, DISCONNECTED, CONFIGURED
